# MyPrivateBlockChain
It is a blockchain for an Astronomy fan which allows him and his friends to register stars, and track the ownership of each. When the application is run, it creates the Genesis Block. It then lets the user to request a message to be signed using a Wallet to verify his ownership. The user then uses his wallet to sign the message and requests to add the star under his ownership using his signature. If the message isn't signed within 5 minutes of the request, the message expires otherwise a new block is created with the encoded Star data. After validation, the new block is added to the chain. The user can then fetch the decoded star data based on ownership.

## Software, Firmware and Hardware
* NodeJS v14.17.3 and latest version of following packages:
  * express (includes body-parser), hex2ascii, morgan
  * bitcoinjs-message, crypto-js
* Bitcoin-core and a wallet to sign the message(s)
* Postman desktop agent (and a compatible browser) to make localhost requests

## Application Endpoints
* '/' - Default to webservice home
* '/breakChain/height/:height' - Alters block's previousBlockHash value to test validation
* '/block/height/:height' - Fetches block by height
* '/block/hash/:hash' - Fetches block by hash
* '/blocks/:address' - Fetches decoded Star(s) data by owner's wallet address
* '/requestValidation' - Requests message to be signed
* '/submitStar' - Requests signature to be verified and Star data to be added to the chain

## Installation instructions
* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
* Download the application locally and do the following:
  * Open a terminal and cd to the main directory
  * Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies
  * Run ```node app.js``` to intialize the webservice
* Open Postman desktop agent (and a compatible browser) to make localhost requests

## Application access
Use Postman desktop agent to do following API calls:
* **GetBlockByHeight** - http://localhost:8000/block/height/<add-height>
* **GetBlockByHash** - http://localhost:8000/block/hash/<add-hash>
* **GetBlocksByOwnership** - http://localhost:8000/blocks/<add-wallet-address>
* **RequestOwnership** - http://localhost:8000/requestValidation
```
{
  "address": <add-wallet-address-in-quotes>
}
```
* **SubmitStar** - http://localhost:8000/submitStar
```
{
  "address": <add-wallet-address-in-quotes>,
  "message": <add-ownership-request-message-in-quotes>,
  "signature": <add-signature-in-quotes>,
  "star": {
            "dec": "70Â° 51.8' 57",
            "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
            "story": "Testing Star 1"
          } // alter star data as needed
}
```
* **InvalidateBlockByHeight** - http://localhost:8000/breakChain/height/<add-height>

## Folder Structure
